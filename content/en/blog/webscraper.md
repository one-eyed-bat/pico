## Overview:
Developed a Python script for scraping job listings from Freelancer.com based on specific criteria, such as job titles containing "Web Scraping." The script provides options for scraping single or multiple pages, allowing users to customize the data extraction process.

## Key Features:
### Single Page Scraping:
Extracts job details, including title, description, and required skills, from a single page on Freelancer.com.

### Multiple Page Scraping:
Enables users to scrape job listings from multiple pages, enhancing the scope of data collection.
Skill Filtering: Filters job listings based on specified skills, ensuring relevance to the user's interests.

### User Input Interaction:
Prompts users for input on the number of pages to scrape and the maximum number of job offers to retrieve.

## How it Works:
Utilizes the BeautifulSoup library for HTML parsing and extraction.
Supports dynamic user interactions to customize the scraping process, including the choice between single or multiple pages.
Employs an object-oriented approach with the Work class to organize and store job details.

## Technologies Used:
Python for scripting.
BeautifulSoup for web scraping.

## Impact:
Facilitates efficient and targeted job searching by automating the retrieval of relevant job listings. Users can tailor the scraping parameters to meet their specific job preferences.
Future Improvements:


*Note: Ensure compliance with the terms of service of the website being scraped and be mindful of ethical considerations when utilizing web scraping tools.*
