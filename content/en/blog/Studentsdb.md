## Overview:
Introducing a personalized Payment Tracking app designed exclusively for my wife, Lila. This bespoke application was crafted to address her unique requirements in managing student payments efficiently, specifically tailored for tax-related purposes.

## Key Features:
### User Input Interaction:
The app provides an intuitive and easy-to-navigate interface, ensuring seamless interaction even for non-technical users.
### New Student Registration:
Simplify the process of adding new students to the system with a dedicated "New Student" feature, streamlining data entry.
### Detailed Student Records:
Capture and organize essential student information, such as names and tax identification numbers (NIFs), in a structured manner.
### Payment Update Functionality:
Easily update and track payments for each student, ensuring accurate financial records.


## How it Works:
The app operates as a centralized hub for managing student payment information. Users can effortlessly add new students, view current student details, and update payment records with just a few clicks. The application's clean and straightforward design enhances user experience, making it an ideal solution for small-scale, personalized use.

## Technologies Used:
The app is built using Go programming language (Golang) for the backend, employing Fyne, a lightweight and user-friendly UI toolkit for the frontend. The integration of SQLite database ensures efficient data storage and retrieval, contributing to a seamless user experience.

## Impact:
This project epitomizes my commitment to addressing real-world needs through practical, tailor-made solutions. While not intended for mass production due to security considerations, the app showcases my dedication to crafting applications that serve specific, tangible purposes. By creating this personalized Payment Tracking app for Lila, I've demonstrated my ability to translate practical requirements into functional software, a skill I aim to bring to future projects.

*Note: The project is an ongoing endeavor, continually being refined to meet evolving requirements and security standards.*
